## Storyline

You have been trapped in this dungeon as long as you can remember.

You are determined to get out, so you pick up some armour and start climbing up the floors.

As you go higher, you get closer to the exit, but the monsters get stronger.

As time goes on, you wonder... what was the reason you were trapped here in the first place?

Is there something more to this place than what it seems?

## Controls

Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to select things.

The enter key and the space bar perform actions and interact with things.

There are also hotkeys, like E, which ends your turn, and B, which goes back in menus.

The 1, 2, 3, and 0 keys view your deck, discard, void, and owned cards, respectively.

You also can press tab to enter fullscreen and escape to exit it.

## How to play

You have a deck of cards, which you draw the top 5 from each turn.

You can play the cards in your hand for the effect(s) they say.

After each battle, you will get rewards, including better cards.

Try to get a good synergy between the cards in your deck.

If you reach 0 health, you die and lose your progress.

However, you can use your new knowledge to reach higher heights next time.

Note: go to the "?" at the top-right of the screen in-game for more details.

## Credits

Inspired by *Slay the Spire* and *Die in the Dungeon*.

Most player sprites are taken from or based off of the sprites in [**this asset pack made by Nauris Amatnieks**](https://aamatniekss.itch.io/fantasy-knight-free-pixelart-animated-character).

The Act 2 background music, *Future Dungeon*, was made in collaboration with Brian Fitzhenry, Jr.

All other art and music is my original work.
