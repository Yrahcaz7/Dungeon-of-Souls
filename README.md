# Dungeon of Souls

## Storyline

You have been trapped in this dungeon as long as you can remember.

You are determined to get out, so you pick up some armour and start climbing up the floors.

As you go higher, you get closer to the exit, but the monsters get stronger.

As time goes on, you wonder... what was the reason you were trapped here in the first place?

Is there something more to this place than what it seems?

## Controls

Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to select things.

Press enter or the space bar to perform an action.

Press tab to enter full screen, and escape to exit it.

## How to play

You have a deck of cards, which you draw the top 5 from each turn.

You can play the cards in your hand for the effect(s) they say.

After each battle, you will get rewards, and you can get better cards.

Try to get a good synergy between the cards in your deck.

If you reach 0 health, you die and lose your progress.

However, you can use your new knowledge to reach higher heights next time.

## Other

Inspired by ***Slay the Spire*** and ***Die in the Dungeon***.

Player sprites taken from [**here**](https://aamatniekss.itch.io/fantasy-knight-free-pixelart-animated-character) and modified slightly.

Some player sprites, however, are only based off of those.

## An ominous feeling...

When the hands align,

find the fragment of time.

Else, at the edge of the sky,

you shall eternally die.
