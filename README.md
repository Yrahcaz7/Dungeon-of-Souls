# Dungeon of Souls

A game in which you are trapped in a dungeon, and you travel upwards towards the exit, defeating monsters and getting stronger.
However, what was the reason you were trapped here in the first place?
Is there something more to this place than what it seems?

Inspired by <b>Undertale</b> and <b>Die in the Dungeon</b>.
